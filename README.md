KAFFIENE 99 – Digital Marketing Strategy
Project Overview

KAFFIENE 99 is a local coffee shop located in Damanhour, Beheira Governorate, Egypt, established in 2018. The café specializes in serving a wide variety of coffee beverages along with selected desserts, offering excellent product quality.
Despite the high quality, the brand suffers from limited awareness due to its weak digital presence. Currently, it only has an inactive Facebook page with very low engagement. Sales rely entirely on in-store purchases, which restricts growth and results in relatively low revenue.

Low engagement and weak audience connection with the brand.

Dependence solely on in-store sales without leveraging digital marketing.

Creating and managing active accounts across major social media platforms.

Producing engaging visual content (photography & videography).

Running targeted paid advertising campaigns to increase brand awareness.

Expanding the customer base and boosting audience interaction.

Supporting sales growth and strengthening the brand’s market position.

Expected Outcomes

Increased followers and engagement across social media platforms.

Enhanced brand awareness in Damanhour and nearby areas.

Growth in sales driven by effective digital marketing.

Establishing KAFFIENE 99 as a competitive local brand.
